# Internet Admin Panel

The Internet Admin Panel is supposed to look like a real admin panel for the
entire internet, but someone accidentally gave full admin permissions to
everyone who visits the website.

While looking official (and perhaps too up to date for an admin panel),
pressing the buttons that appear obviously do not do what they say. In
fact, some just might be hiding a funny surprise.

This is currently a WIP and only two pages currently exist (index and what-have-you-done).
