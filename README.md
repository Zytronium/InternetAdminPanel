# Internet Admin Panel

The Internet Admin Panel is supposed to look like a real admin panel for the
entire internet, but someone accidentally gave full admin permissions to
everyone who visits the website.

While looking official (and perhaps up to date for an admin panel), pressing
the buttons that appear obviously do not do what they say. In fact, some
just might be hiding a funny surprise.

This is currently a major WIP. Not all buttons work, and no other
pages currently exist.
